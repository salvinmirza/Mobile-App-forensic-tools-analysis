<h1>Autopsy Tool</h1>

Autopsy tool is used to analyse and extract data from Android image files. An Android image that has been physically extracted can be loaded and examined using Autopsy. The full /data / data block can be imaged using Android data extraction techniques, as well as any particular frame that is relevant to the investigation. Once the image has been obtained, the investigator can manually browse through the contents and make use of the resources at their disposal to parse through the contents. Call logs, contacts, messages, PS from the browser, and Google Maps data may all be analysed by it. Case management tools, image integrity checks, keyword searches, and other automated processes are all available in Autopsy. By analysing this tool on our android image data source, we were able to extract files such as images, audios, videos, archives, and databases.
